# Brush Guide

**Brush Guide** is an application designed to help translate an image and a set of coordinates into a time-based guide for manual painting. The app generates a sequence that determines the width of your brushstroke as you move your hand from left to right across a canvas using a linear rail.

## Purpose

This tool serves as a "source code" for your hand, providing precise instructions to interpret and reproduce an image manually. Unlike traditional CNC plotting, where a machine acts as the print head, here your hand becomes the print head, guided by the app's output.

## How It Works

- **Input:** An image and coordinate setup.
- **Output:** A time-based guide indicating brushstroke width at each position along the rail.
- **Usage:** Follow the guide as you move your hand steadily from left to right, adjusting brush width as instructed.

## Applications

- Manual CNC-inspired painting
- Experimental art techniques
- Translating digital images into physical brushwork
